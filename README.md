# Mobile_Module_03

I continue building my weather app.  
I improve the design of my app.    
I haven chosen to code in React Native with Expo.  
I used Expo Go on my phone to open the application. [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go)

## Get started

1. Install Node.js

  It will allows you to have the commands npm and npx.
  You can visit this website [NodeJs.org](https://nodejs.org/fr)

2. Move on the project and launch it

   ```bash
   cd mobileModule03/advanced_weather_app
   make install
   make start
   ```
3. Open the app

   Scan the QR code with your phone.
